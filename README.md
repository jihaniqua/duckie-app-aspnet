Assignment for COMP 2084: "Server-Side Scripting-ASP.NET"
by Jihan Duerme

## Assignment requirements
- Plan and create a new .NET Core MVC WebApplication using C#
- Integrate it with a SQL Server database to perform CRUD operations

## Purpose of this application
The purpose of my application is to create a digital space exclusively designed for parents. They can manage various aspects of their child’s life—saving milestones, archiving art project images, documenting medical information, accessing extracurriculars and school schedules, and writing journal entries for their children to read in the future. The application aims to provide one centralized location for essential information and memories, and create a digital time capsule to share with their children.

## Why it is useful
This application provides parents with a convenient way to save and revisit all child-related information in one organized location, making it a useful tool. Firstly, by consolidating essential information, it simplifies the management of multiple sources, saving time otherwise spent searching for or managing scattered records. Secondly, it creates emotional connections and preserves precious memories that 
would be nice to look back to whenever they want. Thirdly, it enables parents to access and collaborate on information, facilitating communication and cooperation among family members.
